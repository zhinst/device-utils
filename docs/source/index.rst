Zurich Instruments Device Utils Documentation
==============================================

zhinst-deviceutils provides a set of helper functions for the native LabOne Python API
called `zhinst.ziPython <https://pypi.org/project/zhinst/>`_.

It offers higher level functions to ease the communication with
`Zurich Instruments <https://zhinst.com>`_ devices. It is not intendet to be a
seperat layer above ``zhinst.ziPython`` but rather as an addition.

It currently has utility functions for the following devices:

* SHFQA
* SHFSG

To see the device utils in action check out the
`LabOne API examples <https://github.com/zhinst/labone-api-examples>`_.
