Quickstart
==========

Eager to get started? This page gives a good introduction to zhinst-deviceutils.
Follow :doc:`installation` to install zhinst-deviceutils first.

Preparation
-----------

Before you can spin up zhinst-deviceutils LabOne® needs to installed and running.
For a complete reference see the dedicated `user manual <http://docs.zhinst.com/>`_
page for your instrument(s).

Before you continue make sure a LabOne® data server is running in your network and
all of your devices are visible.

Session To The Data Server
---------------------------

The device utils provide a set of helper functions to ease the use of commonly
used device functionallities. It can not be used as a standalone package but
rather is an addition to the LabOne python API (``ziPython``).

Each function is stateless/static. This requires every device utils function
to have an argument for the data server session from ``ziPython`` and the serial
of the device the function should be applied to.

The follwoing example shows how a call to the device utils function
``shfqa.max_qubits_per_channel`` could look like for the device ``DEVXXXX``
connected to the dataserver running on ``localhost``.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from zhinst.ziPython import ziDAQServer
    >>> import zhinst.deviceutils.shfqa as shfqa_utils
    >>> daq = ziDAQServer("localhost", 8004, 6)
    >>> daq.connectDevice("DEVXXXX", "1GbE")
    >>> shfqa_utils.max_qubits_per_channel(daq, "DEVXXXX")
    16
